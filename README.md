read the button if b1 on then multiply cs by 2
    ""          if b2         divide cs by 2
    
when pressing b3 then stop selecting cs and start to generate waveï¼Œslope area is 80ms*cs ,flat area is 240-80ms*cs*2(using a for loop to generate) 

sampling at specific rates using sleep_for,printf to ttyACM0 interface and use python to fetch data from ttyACM0 interface ,then we can plot the graph
